<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this repository is to have [the slides](https://user2021.llrs.dev) of my talk for useR!2021 on 05/07/2021. 
Video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/2B7H8WJOX40?t=3291). 

Initially prepared from this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10m2sVWQi2Bjn6GZGLG-kjiodazrzgQJXMSSRAqlqtmI/edit) following the [great post from Emily Riederer](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/writing-a-tech-talk/) based on code and plots from the [posts I did](https://llrs.dev/tags/reviews/).
