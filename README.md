The goal of useR2021 is to prepare for useR!2021 talk: Reviewing packages; how does it work?

To prepare the talk I will follow the [great post from Emily Riederer](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/writing-a-tech-talk/).

Update code and plots from the [posts I did](https://llrs.dev/tags/reviews/).
