# Brief introduction










Goals of a *submission*

- Sharing something of quality that can be useful to others.
- Make it easier for others to build upon your package.
- Other: work, grant, prestige ...

???

Submissions are though specially if coming from places with poor training
Lack of confidence/experience with reviews.

|:--------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|    &lt;a href=https://cran.r-project.org/&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt;    |                        Non-trivial publication quality packages.                         |

???

Differences in objectives but all looking for quality
CRAN: Point errors, comments
Bioconductor: In detail comment of style, classes, dependencies, structure…
rOpenSci: guideline for reviewers (about style, tests, functions, description, documentation, …)


CRAN ~16000 packages, Bioconductor ~2000,  rOpenSci ~300

The different projects/archives have different setups.
*Read the table*
Will use data from the three projects but mostly refer to CRAN.
All of them first you need to pass the automatic checks in place before a human looks into it.

One order of magnitude of difference between each other CRAN &gt; Bioconductor &gt; rOpenSci
Many variability on month
Also very few data collected from CRAN so far (Also there are some hiccups on CRAN collection, near the end of May the CRON job stopped working for a week. )

Packages are moved by reviewers [between folders](https://llrs.dev/2021/01/cran-review/#cran-load).

Many folders but these two are the most important.
There isn't an explanation from CRAN about how do they work.
Pretest is resubmission (newer versions of packages) and also for newbies

Different time, can be shorter or longer.
Most longer need resubmission.
Resubmit with different version (makes it easier to track how many are).

CRAN: 80h
Bioconductor: most of them in 1 month
rOpenSci: in 2 months (seeking 2 reviewers and posting them).

Bioconductor reviewers do a lot
rOpenSci editors too
Both organizations have a group of users involved on the package review system.
Even if Bioconductor doesn't explicitly ask for reviewers from the community.
Bioconductor are considering now how to improve the review system.
Omitted bots bioc-issue-bot and ropensci-review-bot (new March 2021).

Bot provides feedback of many issues and actions performed. 
It can be changed/adapted to change in requirements or errors.
rOpenSci is going to have a bot too [ropensci-review-bot](https://github.com/ropensci-review-bot/).

On bioconductor most problems with the submissions are not the package itself but not replying or chosing another venue.
rOpenSci provides more detailed questioning for scope of a package.

Bioconductor &amp; rOpenSci 50%, some submissions are abandoned or do not fit the project.
Different problems faced by new packages and older ones.
